Packages
========

Since the **Revitron** API enables you to easily create specific extensions for certain projects, you also want to be able to easily 
roll out those extension to your team without individually installing them manually. The **Revitron Package Manager** (RPM)- takes care 
of that.    

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

The package manager basically lets you define a list of **pyRevit** extensions and stores it in Revitron's 
`Document Config Storage <https://revitron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/revitron.document.html#revitron.document.DocumentConfigStorage>`_.
Since your list of dependencies becomes then part of your Revit model you can just synchronize your local file to distribute it to other team members.
To actually load the extension tools, you can hit the **Install Extension** button when needed at any time.

Updating Packages
-----------------

The package manager can also search for available updates automatically. 
When starting Revit, the updater will check for available updates of both --- the pyRevit core and any installed extension. 

.. note::

   The updater shipping with the Revitron UI requires Git to be installed properly on your System in order to pull changes and check for updates. 

In case there are pending updates waiting to be installed they can just be applied with a single click.
In contrast to extension updates, core updates require a shutdown of **all** running Revit instances to proceed. 
So make sure, all open Revit files are saved before installing core updates! 
Note that it is also possible to check for pending updates manually at any time hitting the **Check for Updates** button in the RPM panel.

Forcing Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases you may end up with a *dirty* working copy in one of the installed extensions and 
the updater will not stop asking you to update on every Revit start, because it won't update *dirty* repositories. 
To easily discard all local changes to the extension repositories, you can force updates by hitting 
**Force Extension Updates** in the dropdown below the **Check for Updates** button. 
Note that for now this is only possible for extension repositories and won't work with the pyRevit core.
